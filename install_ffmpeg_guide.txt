       FFmpeg Installation Guide
========================================

If you're experiencing issues with MoviePy, it might be due to missing FFmpeg.
Here's how to install FFmpeg on Windows:

METHOD 1: Download Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
2. Download "release builds" -> "ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip"
3. Extract the zip file to C:\ffmpeg
4. Add C:\ffmpeg\bin to your Windows PATH:
   - Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", press Enter
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System Variables", find "Path", click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add: C:\ffmpeg\bin
   - Click OK on all dialogs
5. Restart your command prompt
6. Test by typing: ffmpeg -version

METHOD 2: Using Chocolatey (if you have it)
-------------------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Run: choco install ffmpeg

METHOD 3: Using Winget (Windows 10/11)
--------------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run: winget install ffmpeg

ALTERNATIVE: Use imageio-ffmpeg (Automatic)
------------------------------------------
If you can't install FFmpeg system-wide, MoviePy can use imageio-ffmpeg
as a fallback. This is automatically installed with MoviePy and should
work without additional setup.

TESTING
-------
After installation, run check_installation.bat to verify everything works.

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
- Make sure to restart your command prompt after installing FFmpeg
- If PATH doesn't work, try placing ffmpeg.exe in your project folder
- For format conversion features, FFmpeg is strongly recommended
